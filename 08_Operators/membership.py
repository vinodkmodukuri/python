# Membership Operators
# The 'in' operator checks if a value exists within an iterable (like a list, tuple, or string).
# The 'not in' operator checks if a value does not exist within an iterable.
# Example usage:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
print("banana" in fruits)  # True
print("grape" not in fruits)  # True
